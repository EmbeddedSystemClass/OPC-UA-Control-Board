# OPC UA Control Board
This project is an ESP32 based OPC UA compatible control board. You may think of it as a demonstration board of an OPC UA server code at:
https://github.com/cmbahadir/opcua-esp32 . Any contributions, especially review and suggestions are welcome.

It is sketched in KiCAD. Currently the board is not sketched, it may require few additional libraries. Latest pdf sketch is under "schematic_v_0_0.pdf".
